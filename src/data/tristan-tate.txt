The DIICOT accuses the Tates of having coerced victims into creating sexually explicit content for websites such as OnlyFans, as part of an organized crime group the Tate brothers allegedly formed in early 2021. Prosecutors say they found six women who had been sexually exploited by the suspects.[22][16]
